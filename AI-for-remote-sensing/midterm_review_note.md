# Definition of learning algorithm
* A machine learning algorithm is the algorithm that is able to learn from data.
* A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of task T and performance measure P, if its performance at task in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
* The task T, performance measure P, and experience E can be very broad => can be classification problem, estimation, prediction, etc.
## The task T
* The learning process is not the task. Learning is our means of obtaining the ability to perform the task.
* Machine learning task can be described in terms of how the machine learning system could process an example, i.e., a collection of features that have been quantitatively measured from some object or events that we want the machine learning system to process.
* Mathematically, an "example" can be represented by $x \subseteq R^n$
