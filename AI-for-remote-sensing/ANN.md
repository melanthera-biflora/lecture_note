# Artificial Neural Networks
* Information processing paradigm inspired by biological nervous systems.
* ANN is composed of a system of neurons connected by synapses.
* ANN learns by examples: adjust synaptic connections between neurons.

# ANN forward propagation
* Information is distributed.
* Information processing is parallel.
