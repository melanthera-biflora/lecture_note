# Decision Tree and Random Forest
* A decision tree is an approach to predictive analysis that can help you make decisions.
* We can also build a tree from numeric data or ranked data.
* In ML world,
  * each node represents a Feature (Attribute)
  * Each link (branch) represents a decision (rule).
  * Each leaf represents an outcome.
=> Several ways to measure impurity: "Gini" impurity is the most popular one.
* Smallest Gini => separate the best.
# Support Vector Machine (SVM)
