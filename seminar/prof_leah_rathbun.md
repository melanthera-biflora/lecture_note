# LiDAR: An Application in Forestry

* Her background is in forestry, focus on LiDAR data.
* Beginning by a plot of reflectance (data of LiDAR).
* Why care about forest management and use LiDAR for?
  * Fire
  * Biomass
  * Habitat for specific species
  * Recreation
* What we need to measure to understand the issue?
  * Density of tree
  * Vegetation
  * Height of the tree
  * How big of the tree
* Interesting thing in her talk: using the shade of trees to determine the insect.
* Black Hills National Forest (what she is working right now):
  * How Black Hills look: a lot of trees.
  * From the image she showed, there are difference in densities => just knowing how the object from LiDAR/ measure the height of trees and know where she could manage the tree.
  * LiDAR was put (2023) on the Black Hills => there is improvement now with more valuable information => can make decision.
  * Would be available for public => now it is still processing.
* When can we collect LiDAR? => How is it different in summer and winter? => Leave fall off, depends on the purposes. 
* Why LiDAR is valuable?
  * Topographic Position Information: How much water the vegetation is getting, where moisture sit => help make decision, where we want to plant the tree.
  * Know the descriptive statistic of height of different areas => Why?
  * From examples, she also shows that it is also useful for hydrology.
* She shows the TPI information from LiDAR to show it is useful for research (to show the location is hill areas, or plat surface)
* She showed us the density reflectance in height matrix of trees => look at height information can tell what is going on with tree and vegetation.=> Interestingly, it is big data and they have one researcher to develop the product for them due to the capacity of supercomputer => Processing the information is challenging.
* She also showed the proportion of the point in height cuts off.
* Other product: use height profile to investigate in crown tree. => Challenge: a lot of density that she cannot see the tree underneath taller one.
* Also get information about canopy cover.
* What's next?
  * Having field data - collecting plot => measures item on tree.
  * Combine the data with cloud metric => develop series of other product through linear regression or random forest model.
