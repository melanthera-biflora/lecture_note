# LiDAR: An Application in Forestry

* Her background is in forestry, focus on LiDAR data.
* Beginning by a plot of reflectance (data of LiDAR).
* Why care about forest management and use LiDAR for?
  * Fire
  * Biomass
  * Habitat for specific species
  * Recreation
* What we need to measure to understand the issue?
  * Density of tree
  * Vegetation
  * Height of the tree
  * How big of the tree
* Interesting thing in her talk: using the shade of trees to determine the insect.
* Black Hills National Forest (what she is working right now):
  * How Black Hills look: a lot of trees.
  * From the image she showed, there are difference in densities => just knowing how the object from LiDAR/ measure the height of trees and know where she could manage the tree.
  * LiDAR was put (2023) on the Black Hills => there is improvement now with more valuable information => can make decision.
  * Would be available for public => now it is still processing.
* She showed us the 
* When can we collect LiDAR? => How is it different in summer and winter? => Leave fall off, depends on the purposes. 
* Why LiDAR is valuable?
  * Topographic Position Information: How much water the vegetation is getting, where moisture sit => help make decision, where we want to plant the tree.
  * Know the descriptive statistic of height of different areas => Why?
