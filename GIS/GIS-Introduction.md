# GIS:
* **Geographic information system (GIS)**: a computer system for capturing, storing, querying, analyzing, and displaying geographically referenced data.
* **Geographically referenced data**: data describes both the location and characteristics of spatial features.
### GIS Application:
* Natural resources management including land-use planning, natural hazard accessment, wildlife habitat analysis, v.v..
* Crime analysis
* Emergency planning
* Land records management
* Market analysis
* Transportation application.
### Components of GIS:
GIS requires 4 components:
* **Computer System**: includes computer and operating system.
* **GIS Software**: program and user interface. Ex: menus, graphical icons, and command lines.
* **Brainware**: refers to purpose and objectives, and provide the reason and justification for using GIS.
* **Infrastructure**: necessary physical, orgranizational, administrative, and cultural environments that support GIS operations.
### GIS Brief History:
* Since 1960s computer have been used to store and process geographically referenced data.
* Problem with GIS in early age: difficult, expensive, and proprietary.

**Notes**: Some GIS software producers and their products:

# Geographically Referenced Data:
Including two components: **spatial data** and **attribute data**.
### Spatial Data:
* Describes the locations of spatial features, which may be discrete or continuous.
* **Discrete features**: individually distinguisable features. Ex: points, lines, areas, v.v..
* **Continuous features**: features exist spatially between observations. Ex: elevation, precipitation, v.v..
