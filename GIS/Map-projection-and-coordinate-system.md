# Introduction
* GIS users work with map features on a two-dimensional or plane surface.
* Problem:
        * Location of map features: based on a plane coordinates system expressed in x- and y- coordinates.
        * Location of spatial features: based on the geographic coordinates system expressed in longitude and latitude values.
=> **Projection** transforms the spherical surface of the Earth to map projection.
* Basic principle: map layers to be used together must have the same coordinates system.
* Projection and Reprojection:
        * *Projection*: converts digital maps from longitude and latitude values to plane coordinates.
        * *Reprojection*: converts from one plane coordinate system to another.
=> Projection and reprojection is the initial task in GIS project.
# Geographic Coordinates System:
* **Geographic Coordinates System** is the location reference system for spatial features on Earth's surface, consisting of meridians and parallels.
* **Meridians**:
        * lines of longitude.
        * running north and south.
        * used for measuring location in the E-W location.
* **Parallel**:
        * lines of latitude.
        * running east and west.
        * used for measuring location in the N-S location.
* Geographic coordinates system is similar to plane coordinates system.
* Longitude \approx *x*
* Latitude \approx *y*
* Latitude > 0 => north of the equator.
* Latitude < 0 => south of the equator.
* Longitude > 0 => eastern hemisphere.
* Longitude < 0 => northern hemisphere.
